# Summary

The Museum Studies curriculum is a **complete education in Museum Studies** using online materials.

The program emphasizes interdisciplinary foundations (drawing from history, art history, anthropology, and cultural studies), core museum practices, ethical and theoretical frameworks, and practical synthesis. It balances theory, historical context, professional skills, and critical reflection.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
