# Summary

The Museum Studies curriculum is a **complete education in Museum Studies** using online materials.

The program emphasizes interdisciplinary foundations (drawing from history, art history, anthropology, and cultural studies), core museum practices, ethical and theoretical frameworks, and practical synthesis. It balances theory, historical context, professional skills, and critical reflection.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

Complete the following sections in sequence:

1. **I. Foundations of Museums and Cultural Heritage**  
   Start here. This section introduces the most basic ideas about what museums are and why they exist.

2. **II. Disciplinary Contexts for Museum Work**  
   Next. This gives you the important outside knowledge (art history, anthropology, global history) that museum professionals rely on every day.

3. **III. Core Museological Functions**  
   This is the longest and most central part. Work through all five subsections (Collections & Stewardship → Ethics, Law, and Professional Standards → Exhibitions & Interpretation → Museum Education & Visitor Engagement → Museum Management & Governance) in the order they appear.  
   These topics cover the practical heart of what museums actually do.

### Specialization Tracks

The remaining sections are **optional specialization tracks** (in **IV. Specialized and Advanced Domains**). You do not need to study all of them. Choose one (or more) depending on your interests and goals after you complete the core:

1. Curatorial & Research Practice  
2. Digital Museums & Technology  
3. Inclusive, Indigenous, and Community-Based Museums  

**V. Contemporary & Global Issues in Museums**: This is a cross-cutting track. Study it after (or alongside) any of the specialization tracks above if you are interested in current debates, future directions, and the bigger societal role of museums today.
