# Other curricula

This curriculum is one of a few efforts to inform learners how they can pursue Museum Studies independently. Below are a few other such efforts.

- [Class Central: Museology Courses](https://www.classcentral.com/subject/museology) – Aggregated list of free online museology and museum-related courses from various platforms.
- [Museum Study: Professional Development Courses](https://www.museumstudy.com/) – Paid but high-quality online courses in museum practices (for reference as an alternative structured path).
